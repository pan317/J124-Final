# The impact of lifestyles across the U.S. under hyperinflation

##By Zixuan Pan

## Story Pitch Summary
The United States is facing the most severe inflation in 40 years due to multiple factors, such as the implementation of massive stimulus measures, rebounding demand, and poor supply chain after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic. Different income groups in the United States face a mismatch between income growth and consumption growth simultaneously, forcing many people to change their lifestyles.

This data analysis report will reveal how people's lives are affected by analyzing consumer index breakdowns and income growth levels. By exploring different data, we will demonstrate how people's life patterns have been impacted since the Covid-19 pandemic.

A recent joint survey by George Mason University's School of Policy and Government and The Washington Post revealed that nearly 90 percent of respondents have begun purchasing cheaper goods, and about three-quarters have reduced spending on dining out and entertainment or postponed scheduled purchases.

The survey conducted by CBS News polling shows that rising prices are making many Americans worry about economic turn to negative expectations and being unable to afford their retirement, vacations, and even daily expenses. One-third of the respondents said they were "very concerned" about their ability to pay for goods and services to meet their basic needs.

## Sourcing

In this project, I analyzed CPI data and core CPI data from [U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category.htm),and also compared with the [personal income growth rate from Federal Reserve](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PI). Also with changes in [personal consumption expenditures](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE) as an important reference factor, the period of these data all from 2020.Jan to 2022.June.

## Data Explore & Analysis

### Key Statements
* All questions were answered using only the above data set.
* All analyses are based on available data and do not represent personal predictive opinions.

### Scope of Analysis 
1) What is the situation of consumption based on the current level of CPI and income growth?
2) Which goods have the highest correlation with CPI and what is the link to the current inflation situation?
3) what types of commodities are the main factors cause high CPI？
4) what are the main factors driving inflation at different times?
5) whether there is some lag in inflation?

### Analysis
1) Analysis 1 ：What is the situation of consumption based on the current level of CPI and income growth?

From Figure 1 to Figure 5, people can see that personal income has little growth during this period, while personal necessities such as food, energy, and medical supplies all tend to rise significantly. Therefore, personal consumption no longer has a strong growth momentum under the high prices; instead, it has turned into a contraction of consumption, as shown in Figure 6 Personal Consumption Expenditures Change Rate.

2) Analysis 2 ：Which goods have the highest correlation with CPI and what is the link to the current inflation situation?

As you can see from the CPI Components table above, the highest proportion of the CPI's statistical weights is the OER, or Owners' Equivalent Rent, which has not increased much; therefore, the overall CPI has not increased by double digits, and the increase in its weight after the revision has depressed inflation at the data level.

3) Analysis 3 ：what types of commodities are the main factors cause high CPI？

As seen by the eighth data chart CPI Five wWighted Commodity Change Comparison, under the chain of commodity growth, only the energy category pulled away from the other commodities by a significant margin. Although its weight is not the highest, the percentage of increase is striking and is currently the main factor of inflation.

4) Analysis 4 ：what are the main factors driving inflation at different times?

First, open the CPI table provided by the National Bureau of Statistics. We used the MAX formula to get the most significant increase in each month of goods, as shown in the figure below. We can see that except for the beginning of the epidemic, such as from March to September 20, when the surge in demand for medical supplies led to an increase in medical supplies, the rest of the month's inflation was caused by oil. Also the graph of "CPI Comparison Of Major Commodity Data" above can support this opinion.

5) Analysis 5 ：whether there is some lag in inflation?

As you can see in the sorted data table in the chart, the green represents the three months with the most significant statistical increase in oil, the orange represents the three months with the most notable statistical increase in overall inflation, and the orange represents June 2022 for both. We can see that the surge in the rate of commodities may not be the biggest overall increase in the month, and its effect on overall inflation depends on other items and the conduction to the market also takes some time.
